```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(blanks)


data <- getNorm(recs = c(76211, 140548))
data %>%
  filter(norm_ratio > -1,
         gf_co2_qty > 80,
         str_sub(wheel, 1, 5) == "CFAMS") %>%
  group_by(rec_num) %>%
  summarize(fm = mean(norm_ratio),
            fm_sd = sd(norm_ratio))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
